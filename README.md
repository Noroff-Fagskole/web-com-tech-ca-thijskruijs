# Goal

> To put into practice the technologies you’ve learned in Web and Communications Technology.

## Brief

In this assignment, you have been tasked with organising your files and folders in order to start developing the website on which you chose to work in Design.

## Level 1 Process

1. Create a repository on GitHub for your project.
2. Clone the repository to your computer and open in VS Code.
3. Create and add a `index.html` file in this repository. This file will act as the homepage.
4. Create folders called: `css`, `js`, and `images`.
   1. They can be empty folders for now (and if they are empty they won’t show on GitHub).
   2. We’ll add to them as we progress in the programme.
   3. Commit and push changes to your repository.
5. Deploy the site using Netlify.

## Level 2 Process

Consider making updates or tweaks to the prototype you made for the Design CA. Next we will start developing the site, so if there are any design changes or modifications you want to make, now is a good time to make them.

## Submission

- A link to your GitHub repository (make sure it’s public so we can see it
- A link to your deployed site on Netlify.
